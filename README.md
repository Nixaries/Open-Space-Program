# Open-Space-Program
An open source rocket building simulator built in godot

## Why Godot?
Godot seems like the most accessible open source engine around and I would like to make this project as accessible as possible to everyone

## Is it playable now?
No. This is currently more or less a fresh project that has just begun development. Will update this as development continues
